Welcome to my SoC Tapeout Program (VSD) Journey!
This repository documents my week-by-week progress throughout the program.

In this program, I am learning to design a System-on-Chip (SoC) from RTL to GDSII using open-source tools.
It is part of India’s largest collaborative RISC-V tapeout initiative, enabling 3500+ participants to gain 
hands-on silicon design experience and contribute to the nation’s semiconductor ecosystem.
